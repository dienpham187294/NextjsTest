                "Taiwanese-invested footwear maker Pouyuen Vietnam suspended 3,546 workers from the Mekong Delta Province of Tien Giang for seven days starting Friday for Covid-19 contact tracing.",
                "According to Pouyuen Vietnam, the workers are employed across the factory. Temporarily suspending them would affect its business, forcing many staff to work overtime or causing the factory to reduce production.",
                "Pouyuen Vietnam is the biggest employer in HCMC with 56,000 workers. Of these, 13,500 are from neighboring localities including the Mekong Delta Province of Tien Giang, Long An, Dong Thap, Ben Tre and the southern province of Tay Ninh, who commute to work via company transport.",
                "Over 600 company buses are used daily to pick up its workers. These now carry less than 20 people following Covid-19 prevention measures.",
                "Pouyuen Vietnam recorded its first Covid-19 case on June 8, which caused nearly 600 employees to temporarily stop work and be quarantined.",
                "HCMC has recorded the second-highest number of local infections since the new wave started on April 27. Its case count has reached 2,343 Friday afternoon."

                "In the first six days of its latest vaccination campaign, HCMC has administered more than 400,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses, half of the number it planned to finish in a week.",
                "The city had last Saturday launched a major vaccination campaign against Covid-19, the biggest in the city and the nation's history. It planned to use up 806,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it has within seven days. These are part of the 966,320 doses provided by Japan.",
                "Nguyen Tan Binh, director of HCMC's Health Department, said Friday that on the first day of the campaign, the city inoculated 877 people at Saigon Hi-Tech Park in Thu Duc City.",
                "The city has then set up many vaccination centers across districts, targetting vulnerable communities and workers at industrial zones.",
                "The campaign has taken up speed in the past three days and by the end of Thursday, 404,700 people have been vaccinated, Binh said.",
                "Another 40,412 people did not receive the vaccine despite showing up. Some decided to halt the vaccination on their own while others had conditions that do not meet the criteria required for getting the jab.",
                "Explaining for the campaign falling behind schedule, Binh said this was the first time the city organized such a vaccination program with such a large number of people.",
                "There were problems in the coordination between units and maintaining order during the first days.",
                `But if the city can maintain the momentum like on recent days, it can "basically finish" the job by the end of Saturday, he said.`
