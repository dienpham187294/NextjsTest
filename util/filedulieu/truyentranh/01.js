They had played all day but now that it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do.  They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home.  “I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another game of – of something”.  Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek”.  "

Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.  In the distance they could still hear Mark counting “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here  I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places where they could be hiding.  "

It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why?. Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They could smell it. And now they could see it. The fire was coming towards them! "

Now she could see a place where there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone run this way”. All of the animals followed her and ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were out of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe. All the animals looked around; they were all there. "

It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didn’t have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again, so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds. "
