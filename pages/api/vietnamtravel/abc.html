<p><span>Lâm Giang</span></p>
<p><span>The Central Highlands province of Gia Lai not only has majestic forests, endless coffee fields, poetic Biển Hồ
                (Sea Lake) and&nbsp;immense green tea hills, it also has a beautiful and unique pagoda named Minh
                Thành.</span></p>
<p><span>I was lucky enough&nbsp;to visit this pagoda after a two-day assignment in Pleiku City.</span></p>
<p><span>The pagoda is located in the heart of the city on a gentle hill on Nguyễn Viết Xuân Street. It has a unique,
                Japanese and Chinese-style architecture with exquisite carvings and a beautiful green campus, creating a
                peaceful&nbsp;space.</span></p>
<p><span>The pagoda was built in 1964 by Most Venerable Thích Giác Đạo and has since been&nbsp;restored and become more
                beautiful and splendid.</span></p>
<p><span>From a distance, the pagoda looks like a miniature palace in the misty and mountainous city. I could easily see
                the curved roofs of the pagoda amidst the blue sky. The pagoda was embraced by a fanciful mist that made
                it feel as if I was in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span>The pagoda yard is quite large and decorated with stone statues and wooden materials carved sophisticatedly. It
                also has a very green space&nbsp;designed with trees to make the atmosphere fresh and pure. Around the
                lake, many small willow trees hang down.</span></p>

<p><span>In the small alleys of the pagoda, there are many mossy walls&nbsp;interlaced with creeping vegetation,
                evidence of the age of the temple.</span></p>
<p><span>Minh Thành Pagoda has a total area of more than 20,000sq.m. The architecture of the pagoda is built in the form
                of a mandala which represents the universe and&nbsp;all the details carved here follow the foundation of
                Buddhist philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span>When arriving at the pagoda, I saw a nine-story relic tower, standing majestically amid the blue sky. The
                72m-high tower is painted gold and is one of the tallest architectural works of Pleiku. The tower is
                built in the Japanese architectural style with a distinctive curved roof.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The pagoda's main hall can be seen after passing a&nbsp;three-entrance gate. Its ceiling was made of&nbsp;<i>pơ
                        mu</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>a type of wood which is well known in the local forests. The six entrance
                doors are made of wood with a thickness of 20cm and carved with six Bodhisattvas.</span></p>
<p><span>The main worshipping hall has two stories, Đại Hùng Bửu Điện and Đại Bi Điện. Inside the hall is a Buddhist
                altar which is 6m long and 1.2m high. In the four corners are four statues of the Bodhisattva of
                Compassion.</span></p>
<p><span>The left of the hall is the two-storey bell tower with two bells, in which the heaviest bell weighs 3 tonnes.
                The right side is a three-storey tower, Từ Ân. It is decorated with stylised dragons and lotus flowers.
                It was built very similarly to the Japanese temple architecture but still has a Vietnamese cultural
                identity.</span></p>

<p><span>The main hall’s walls are decorated with more than 3,000 statues, all embossed into the wall very
                elaborately.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a big statue of Amitabha in the middle of Liên Trì Lake&nbsp;in front of the pagoda. The stone statue
                is 7.5m high and weighs 40 tonnes. Next to it is the largest bronze incense burner in Việt Nam, weighing
                4 tonnes. After ascending 30 stone steps, I was surprised at the architectural beauty of the
                pagoda.</span></p>
<p><span>Strolling slowly under the trees, listening to the bell of the pagoda ring and the scent of frankincense
                spreading in the space, I felt&nbsp;lost in a fairyland. I took a deep breath and enjoyed some peace,
                quiet in the misty land of the mountainous city. — VNS</span></p>
